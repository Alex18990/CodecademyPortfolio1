                <h2>Regression</h2>
                <p id="first">Regressions to past lives are a relatively new type of psychotherapy that uses meditative states to find suppressed emotions, 
                    traumas, and to uncover beliefs and behavior patterns that may affect present life. This involves the use of a conscious trance—in 
                    simple terms, a meditation with visualization in which you actively participate. For example, when you dream about something or ponder—it 
                    is also a trance state. In this case, we manage and direct this trance, guiding consciousness in the desired direction.</p>
                <p id="second">As the name suggests, during the trance, a person is invited to imagine themselves in one of their past lives. It's worth adding 
                    that people are not only sent to a past life; they can also go to a future or parallel one. It is important to review this life and 
                    experience the moment of death. Then, there is a meeting with one's mentors in the planning place. Here we can find out how we dealt with 
                    the challenges of this life, whether there were any issues with past situations, agreements with other people or organizations, 
                    meet guardian angels, gain access to universal knowledge, and much more.</p>
                <p id="third">At first glance, it might seem like some nonsense filled with mysticism and esotericism. I am often asked questions like, 
                    "How do you know it was actually a past life? Maybe I just made it up right now?" Of course, I don't know if it was really your past life.
                    But the fact that you imagined it—that's exactly what I needed. You didn't just imagine, but actively felt everything around you and 
                    experienced it emotionally (and I'll take care of that).</p>
                <p id="fourth">As a psychologist, the authenticity of the described events is not important to me—what matters is what your subconscious produces. 
                    Although sometimes such interesting facts and connections arise, for example with lineage, that there is no doubt about the value of these 
                    fantasies.</p>
                <p id="fifth">The fact is that throughout life we accumulate a huge amount of unexperienced, suppressed, and displaced emotions. Some of these are 
                    inherited from parents and surroundings. The problem is that traumatic or suppressed memories do not vanish into oblivion but continue to 
                    live and actively influence our behavior, causing unfounded fears, emotions, behavior patterns, and internal constraints. Their impact on us
                    remains "invisible and incomprehensible." Our consciousness has repressed them and now cannot notice and recognize them. Muscle spasms and 
                    illnesses are often the only way for suppressed subconscious experiences to reach out to us with a plea for release, to remind us of 
                    themselves and to painfully break out from the "dungeon of the soul."</p>
                <p id="sixth">The fact is that the path to the subconscious lies through a multitude of our defense mechanisms, whose task is to keep the prisoners 
                    at any cost far from our consciousness. Maintaining this takes up a lot of life energy. Essentially, in Ayurveda, this is called mental 
                    Ama (or toxins), which is considered the primary cause of physical body diseases.</p>
                <p id="seven">Due to the strong defense mechanisms that can trap a person, we often have to come up with various "deceptive" methods. Therefore, 
                    sometimes when you visit a psychotherapist, you might be asked to imagine something, tell a story, draw a picture, play with "dolls," 
                    or perform a special breathing exercise. All of these seemingly unusual activities are done to bypass the conscious mind and reach what is 
                    hidden deep within.</p>
                <p id="eight">Past life regressions use trance and guide you to view one of your past lives (or, as I mentioned before, future or parallel lives – the 
                    distinction doesn't really matter). The key is for you to start telling and experiencing stories that are "not about you." People don't 
                    invent anything that is "not about themselves." In any of our creations, a part of the embodied subconscious will always be visible. 
                    This way, suppressed experiences have the opportunity to freely manifest. The most valuable aspect is that a person can independently 
                    discover the cause and origin of traumatic situations and change their patterns of behavior/reactions in the present and future.
